# Cards

## Getting started
Remember, after you have installed the HubSpot CLI, you can now open up the simple_version and run `hs project dev` and start developing live!

## Simple Version
Perfect as a boilerplate for students to start with. Very bare bones but ready for you to take it to the next level.

## Advanced Version
[Carter](https://hubspot.dad) did an awesome job building out this advanced card. It includes the following features:
- Postal Code (zipcode) lookup
- Distance calcuation from zip code to Location custom object.
- Filter vehicle objects by location, availablility, and type of rental.

This card shows you some of the powerful features of UI extensions.
